Footnotes:
1,"Population estimates based on the Standard Geographical Classification (SGC) 2021 as delineated in the 2021 Census."
2,"Census subdivision (CSD) is the general term for municipalities (as determined by provincial/territorial legislation) or areas treated as municipal equivalents for statistical purposes (e.g., Indian reserves, Indian settlements and unorganized territories). Municipal status is defined by laws in effect in each province and territory in Canada. Census subdivisions (CSDs) are classified into <a href="https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/ref/dict/tab/index-eng.cfm?ID=t1_5" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">57 types (opens new window)</a> according to official designations adopted by provincial, territorial or federal authorities. Two exceptions are 'subdivision of unorganized' (SNO) in Newfoundland and Labrador, and 'subdivision of county municipality' (SC) in Nova Scotia, which are geographic areas created as equivalents for municipalities by Statistics Canada, in cooperation with those provinces, for the purpose of disseminating statistical data."
3,"Postcensal estimates are based on the latest census counts adjusted for census net undercoverage (including adjustment for incompletely enumerated reserves and settlements) and on the estimated population growth that occurred since that census, as calculated using fiscal data. Intercensal estimates are based on postcensal estimates and census counts adjusted of the censuses preceding and following the considered year. Population estimates for census subdivisions (CSDs) in Quebec are provided by "l'Institut de la statistique du Québec". Population estimates for CSDs in Alberta are provided by Alberta’s Office of Statistics and Information (OSI) in current geography for July 1, 2016 and after. They are converted to the appropriate standard geographical classification using geographical relationships provided by the OSI. Due to this geographical difference, small discrepancies may exist between CSD populations released by Statistics Canada for Alberta and those found directly on the <a href="https://www.alberta.ca/office-statistics-information.aspx" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">OSI’s website (opens new window)</a>. CSD population estimates for Alberta prior to July 1, 2016 are produced using the same method adopted for provinces and territories that do not provide their own estimates. Territorial-level population estimates for Yukon are produced by Statistics Canada, while census subdivision population estimates are supplied by the <a href="https://yukon.ca/en/bureau-of-statistics" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Yukon Bureau of Statistics (opens new window)</a> for July 1, 2019 and after. Variations in total population estimates at the territorial level between both sources are due to methodological differences. Population estimates for CSDs in Yukon prior to July 1, 2019 are not shown in this table and can be found on the <a href="https://yukon.ca/en/bureau-of-statistics" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Yukon Bureau of Statistics website (opens new window)</a>. Population estimates for census subdivisions in Northwest Territories are provided by the <a href="https://www.statsnwt.ca/index.html" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Northwest Territories Bureau of Statistics (opens new window)</a> for July 1, 2001 and after, excluding unorganized regions. Variations in total population estimates at the census division level between these and those produced by Statistics Canada are due to methodological differences."
4,"Population estimates as of July 1 are final intercensal up to 2020, final postcensal for 2021, updated postcensal for 2022 and 2023, and preliminary postcensal for 2024."
5,"In order to categorize CSDs by population size (5,000-plus; under 5,000), population estimates as of July 1, 2021 are used. Moreover, within each category, CSDs are presented in ascending order on the basis of their population as of July 1, 2021."
6,"Population estimates by age and gender for census subdivisions are available upon request as a custom cost-recovery product by contacting the Centre for Demography client services mailbox (statcan.demography-demographie.statcan@statcan.gc.ca)."
7,"This table replaces table 17100142."
